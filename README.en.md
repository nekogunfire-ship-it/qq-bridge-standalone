> **The following major parts were independently designed and implemented in this repository by [@nekogunfire-ship-it](https://github.com/nekogunfire-ship-it):**
>
> - a Direct AI Runtime that operates without DSH, including model probing, hot switching, and standalone configuration;
> - the redesigned desktop UI, status guidance, actionable diagnostics, and runtime configuration experience;
> - optimized session and tool-call logic, shared runtime utilities, and code simplification;
> - API-key isolation, log masking, privacy scanning, secure packaging, and release sanitization;
> - automated verification for standalone operation, desktop wiring, UI behavior, MCP tools, security, and release packages.

Current version author and maintainer: [@nekogunfire-ship-it](https://github.com/nekogunfire-ship-it)

> Connect QQ messages to DeepSeek Harness (DSH) agents: QQ friends/groups become DSH conversations, and agent replies (including questions and tool approvals) are sent back to QQ.

> ⚠️ **Current release `v0.2.1` supports DSH 0.1.5-rc.1 and can also run completely without DSH through Direct Runtime.** The installer can optionally add DSH compatibility components, ComfyUI, and the SDXL image model. DSH mode uses Cookie auth, slash RPC endpoints, and the `/api/remote.mux` event stream.
>
> The default branch `main` **is** this version — a plain `git clone` gets it, no branch switching needed.

## Architecture

```
QQ messages ──► SnowLuma (OneBot v11 WS) ──► qq-bridge ──► DSH Web API (127.0.0.1:3080/api)
                                                    ▲                      │
                                                    └── agent replies / questions / approvals ┘
```

- **QQ side**: `@snowluma/sdk` provides the OneBot v11 WebSocket client.
- **DSH side**: adapted for DSH 0.1.2+ and re-verified on 0.1.5 — launch-token Cookie auth, `/api/<namespace>/<method>` slash RPC, and `/api/remote.mux` + `session/follow` event stream. The per-session model is pinned by the bridge via `session.selectModel` from `config.json`'s `dsh.model` (default `deepseek-flash` = DeepSeek-V41-Flash, multimodal).
- **Agent tools**: safe MCP servers expose a restricted QQ toolset (`qq_status`, `qq_list_groups`, `qq_get_group_history`, `qq_send_group_message`, `qq_reply`, etc.).
- **Console**: a local web console at `http://127.0.0.1:3100` for mode switching, role management, whitelist/admin settings, slang management, memory, stickers and more.

## Features

- Bridges QQ group/private messages to DSH agent sessions.
- Social simulation mode ("simulated group friend") with idle/active/probing/exiting states.
- Space-based message splitting for more natural multi-message replies.
- Whitelist/blacklist access control, fail-closed by default.
- Sensitive text audit prevents paths/credentials from being sent to QQ.
- MCP tools for reading group history/members, sending messages, replying with quotes, and (in `reserved2`) full simulated-group-friend tooling.
- Slang/network-expression learning with human confirmation.
- Lightweight memory system for active topics, pending thoughts and member impressions.
- Sticker library integration with AI-friendly sticker usage.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 22.13
- Running DeepSeek Harness Web (default `http://127.0.0.1:3080`)
- Running SnowLuma with OneBot v11 WebSocket and HTTP API enabled

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install        # postinstall automatically patches the @snowluma/sdk ESM packaging bug
```

Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json`, then edit:

```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
```

Key settings:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `dsh.baseUrl` | DSH Web API URL, default `http://127.0.0.1:3080` |
| `dsh.authToken` | DSH launch token used to exchange for a browser-session cookie in DSH 0.1.2. Leave empty to auto-discover from `~/.dsh/guard/logs/server-*.out.log`; the bridge also re-discovers it automatically after a DSH restart / 401 |
| `dsh.authHeader` / `dsh.authPrefix` | Legacy fields kept for compatibility; the current DSH 0.1.2 path uses Cookie exchange and does not send this header |
| `snowluma.wsUrl` | SnowLuma OneBot **WebSocket** URL (e.g. `ws://127.0.0.1:3001`) |
| `snowluma.accessToken` | OneBot access token, leave empty if not configured |
| `snowluma.httpUrl` | OneBot **HTTP API** URL (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:3000`); do not point this at the WebSocket port or you will get HTTP 426 |
| `ownerQQ` | Administrator QQ (highest privilege) |
| `allow.private` / `allow.groups` | Whitelist of QQ/group IDs |
| `consolePort` | Local console port, default `3100` |

Start:

```bash
npm start
```

Or double-click `start.bat` on Windows (guard mode with auto-restart).

## DSH Setup on Another Device

The bridge and console can run without extra DSH setup, but the two DSH chat presets (`qq-chat` and `qq-chat-v2`) and the MCP servers must be installed into DSH once per machine:

```bash
node scripts/setup-dsh.mjs
```

This installs:

- `~/.dsh/.agent-presets/qq-chat` and `~/.dsh/.agent-presets/qq-chat-v2`
- MCP entries in `~/.dsh/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml`
- `qq-mode-console` in the profile `package.json`
- Default DSH mode set to `reserved2` (second-generation simulation), with a local `state/mode.json` fallback

Then restart DSH. See [docs/DSH_SETUP.md](docs/DSH_SETUP.md) for details.

## Security Notes

- `config.json` and `state/` are **never committed**; the repository only ships `config.example.json`.
- MCP send tools enforce whitelist checks and reject CQ-code injection.
- Local paths, credentials, tokens and other sensitive patterns are filtered by the audit layer.
- Process control for SnowLuma (`start_snowluma` / `stop_snowluma`) is disabled by default and only allowed in `closed-agent` mode when explicitly enabled.
- The console uses a generated token when none is configured.

## Repository Layout

```
qq-bridge/
  config.example.json   # sanitized config template (real config.json is not in repo)
  docs/
    PROJECT_GUIDE.md    # detailed Chinese guide
  dsh/agent-presets/    # qq-chat / qq-chat-v2 DSH agent preset templates
  plugins/qq-mode-console  # DSH plugin: registers the qq-mode settings namespace (host half only; no UI card yet)
  src/                  # bridge core and MCP servers
  public/
    console.html        # local web console
  roles/                # persona cards

  scripts/              # tests and helper scripts
  state/                # runtime data (not in repo)
```

## Testing

`npm run test:audit` runs isolated regression tests without production credentials, DSH, or QQ messages. The detailed audit is in [docs/AUDIT_REPORT_2026-09-18.md](docs/AUDIT_REPORT_2026-09-18.md) (Chinese).

After upgrading, legacy QQ session mappings without permission metadata are recreated once. Mode or preset changes also retire the old mapping and recreate the session on the next message; DSH history is retained.

```bash
npm run self-test       # DSH-side link test, no QQ/SnowLuma required
npm run test-md
npm run test-wait
npm run test-vision
npm run test-forward
npm run test-slang
npm run test-stickers
```
